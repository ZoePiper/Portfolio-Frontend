# 5. People Counter

This is a project build to learn JavaScript.
Click <a href="https://zingy-bavarois-025ec2.netlify.app"> here </a>to see the live app.

A free online tool for counting. It can be used as a clicker for events to count people, as an inventory counting tool, industrial step counting, workouts, sports scores, or a myriad of other use cases.

In order to use the tool you can click the plus button to increment by one, and click the minus button to decrement it. You can also save your results and see your previous result.

Nice to have when I will improve this app:
<ul><li> rest option</li> 
<li> set different value</li> 
<li> fill in maximum capacity</li> 
<li> show current capacity</li> 
<li> view detailed statistics</li> 
<li> save a report.</li> 
<li> name the count section</li> 
<li> export to csv</li> 
<li> track all your activities</li> 
  </ul>

<b>What have I learned?</b>
<ul>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>Scripting</li>
    <li>document.getElementByID</li>
  <li>textContent</li>
    <li>increment</li>
    <li>reset</li>
    <li>onclick</li>
    <li>making functions</li>
  <li>DOM</li>
    <li>console.log</li>

</ul>
