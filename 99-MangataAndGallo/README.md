## Design problem. 
Using your new knowledge of HTML and CSS you need to create a semantic structure with a header, main content and footer. Decide between a grid or flexbox for your layout. The client’s logo needs to be in the header and the main content needs to have a large promotional banner and three columns with text and images below it. The footer should have two columns. The first column must contain a smaller version of the logo and the second column should have copywriting information. 

In terms of styling, you should use your creativity to create the appropriate look and feel to capture the attention of the client’s target audience. You should use your knowledge about CSS selectors and effects to create the appropriate intentional engagement that would serve your client best.

## Solution. 
Scaling and rotating the cards slightly when hoovering over the images
.card img:hover {
      transform: rotate(2deg) scale(108%);
      transition: transform 0.5s;
      
making cards responsive. Add this code to the container that wraps all the cards
 .cardgroup {
      display: flex;
      gap: 20px;
      justify-content: space-evenly;
      flex-wrap: wrap;
  }

## Design process. 
This was a final project for Coursera Frontend course from Meta (HTML & CSS)
Source: https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-and-css-in-depth/home/week/3

##Results. 
It's a nice home page for a juwler. Making a website dynamic must be in a very subtle way or it becomes a irritating gimic. I'll have to look into this more.
Images really finishes a website

##What's next 
The movement of the card be be subtler or taken out.
Fill the rest of the pages.
Change the flexbox so it is responsive.
